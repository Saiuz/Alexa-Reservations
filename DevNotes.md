Development Notes
=================

**I left off here:**

  ax-reservation-details directive, need to work through logic for checkout.

  ax-reservation-list directive, need a way of indicating when a reservation is fully checked in and when
  it is checked out (strike-through text?)

 **To-do items:**

 1. Need to re-purpose the reservation details directive to show basic info about the reservation with buttons
    to checking, checkout edit and view etc the reservation. **In Progress**
 2. Redesign the home page, move the stats to a separate page, add the graphic view zimmer plan and the three lists
    currently there.
 3. Need to develop the checkin logic for a group reservation. For multi-bill group res need to check in the rooms
    individually.
 4. expense items must be modified to include room numbers so that expenses can be assigned to each room
 5. Figure out how to handle the old Kur functionality where we need individual bills for two people in the same room.
